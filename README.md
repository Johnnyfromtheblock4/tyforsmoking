I want to recreate the breakout game in this style
I also want to add this feature:
-change the bar (it should look like a cigarette)
-add more levels after you win (4 in totals)-the shape of the brick in the last level should look like the pic called lungs.png
-add a leaderboard when the winner can write is name and this would be saved
-make the level go harder every level
-add a sharable card using the image smoke.png and a box saying "you broke the habit"
-every player must put a name before the game starts so he can have the name on the leaderboard
-add also cool effect
I dont know why the cigBar is still in that colour PLEASE HELP!
